# Analysis and Design of Algorithms

This repository contains course materials, assignments, and resources for the **Analysis and Design of Algorithms** course, part of the Data Science Bachelor's program at IPN (Instituto Politécnico Nacional).

## Course Overview

The primary goal of this course is to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to determine the most suitable algorithm for solving a given problem, based on design strategies and algorithmic complexity.
